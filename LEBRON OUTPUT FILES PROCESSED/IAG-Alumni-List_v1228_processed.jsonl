We are opening up this program to alumni in other geographic areas as well who are willing to communicate over phone or email. Our members would really appreciate to learn from your personal/professional journeys! | q20: Would you be interested in participating in IAG's Alumni Workshop Series? \\n\\n\\n\\nOur IAG Alumni Workshop Series this spring is aimed at taking advantage of the alumni's vast wealth of knowledge as a catalyst for mentorship. The structure of these workshops are highly flexible, ranging from alumni-led lectures, case walkthroughs, panels, to fireside chats. We see these workshops as educational in nature, taught by members of alumni to the current club members. Not only can these teach-ins be highly educational, they are also a great way for members interested in a specific topic to touch base with you all afterward. We are hoping to host these workshops during Wednesday Common Hour (12:30 PM - 13:30 PM ET), though the exact length of the presentation is up to your discretion.\\n\\n\\n*All events will be held remotely unless permitted by NYU | q17: Would you be interested in taking part in IAG's Battle of the Alumni pitch?\\n \\n\\nWe would like to bring back an IAG tradition since 2011 – Battle of the Alumni – in which two alumni will work with current P-Team members to argue two different investment theses on the same company.
