Not only does it allow fans to see exciting games and seasons, but it has an effect on team and league revenues, player salaries, and the overall demand for a sport. Competitive balance is imperative to the success of any league, and almost every professional sport has had some attempt made to alter the competitive balance in an effort to increase the success of that league. Although competitive balance and the severity of its impact on a league vary from sport to sport, the underlying principle of the uncertainty of outcome hypothesis is universal.\\n\\nThe uncertainty of outcome hypothesis states that fans are most interested in games when the home team has a 60 to 70 percent chance of winning. Ultimately, a more competitively balanced league, one where the most teams have an equal chance of winning, will be more successful in the eyes of owners and fans alike. This paper will attempt to analyze the competitive balance of the English Premier League and how it has changed over the last three years, from 2006/07 to 2008/09. After reviewing other findings on the subject of competitive balance, I will measure the competitive balance of the EPL for each three seasons, determine whether balance exists or not, and then assess the factors attributing to these results.\\n\\nLiterature Review:\\n\\nMany academic papers and journals have been written about competitive balance, most likely as a result of its importance in the wide world of sports. From fan attendance to media revenues, competitive balance is a factor that cannot be ignored. Considering the effect it has on the demand for a sport, competitive balance plays a crucial role in fan attendance of any league. In regards to the English Premier League, Stefan Szymanski believes the EPL offers a natural experiment for measuring the relationship between competitive balance and fan interest. Because teams simultaneously compete in both the EPL and FA Cup matches, the trends of fan attendance are comparable. He found that income inequality between divisions had grown, implying that the FA Cup was becoming more unbalanced than the EPL. As a result, fan attendance steadily declined for same-division matches. In summary, the more unbalanced a league is the less fan attendance they will see.\\n\\nAccording to Michie and Oughton, there are different aspects within competitive balance that must be understood in order to fully comprehend its effects on the league. Mentioned earlier, the uncertainty of outcome is important to competitive balance, particularly to spectators and TV viewers. When the outcome is predictable with a degree of certainty, spectators decrease compared to when the outcome is less certain, thus revenues are lower and the league is less successful. Long-term domination is also an important aspect of competitive balance. During the first 12 years of the EPL, one club (Manchester United) won the title 8 times, and two clubs (Man U and Arsenal) have won 11 titles. From a rank-order perspective, the EPL seems to be very unbalanced. Finally, there is seasonal uncertainty, where the uncertainty of outcome as to who is going to win the championship is central. Simply put, the chance any team will win is determined throughout the season. If the championship outcome was determined early on in the season, the later games would be less important and demand for those games would decrease.\\n\\nMeasurements:\\n\\nFor my analysis, I measured the competitive balance over 3 seasons of the EPL using within-season variation. To do this, I found the win percentage for each team and calculated the standard deviation from the mean win percentage (.500). Results show first, that the league was much more balanced in the first season (2006/07) than in recent years. From 2006/07 to 2007/08, the standard deviation increased by about 27%, a fairly significant jump. Second, while the lower positioned teams seem to be somewhat mixed, the same 4 teams are at the top of the table each year. At first glance, the EPL seems to have very poor competitive balance.\\n\\nI found the standard deviation for the 2006/07 season to be .177. While this number alone means very little other than it is a relatively small deviation, when compared to the later season it can explain quite a bit. For instance, the standard deviation in 2007/08 was .226, as noted earlier a 27% increase. Competitive balance was severely reduced. However, balance improved in the most recent season (2008/09) with a standard deviation of .207.5\\n\\nWithin-season variation is only one of many measures of competitive balance. Based on my calculations, the competitive balance of the EPL seems to be good and fairly stable as of late, but it is hard to say when there is no base for comparison. A comparison across sports or leagues can be done using the ratio of actual standard deviation to the ideal standard deviation. For example, when comparing the EPL to Major League Soccer (MLS) one can calculate the ideal standard deviation by dividing .5, which is the 50% chance each team has to win, by the square root of the number of games played by each team. This allows comparison because it provides the base (ideal) standard deviation for each sport/league.\\n\\nAnother useful measure of competitive balance can be done using between-season variation. Also known as turnover or team-specific variation, it is distinguished from within-season variation in that it measures the relative positions of teams in the standings each year rather than in one given season.6 This takes into account that each year a team has a chance to move up in the standings. However, this measure does have one flaw in that it does not allow for a standard comparison like within-season variation does.\\n\\nFinally, the frequency of championships also can  be used to measure competitive balance within a league. It is based on the same principles as the previous measure, but uses championships rather than league standings to compare balance. For example, the three seasons of the EPL used in this analysis show that the “Big 4” (Liverpool, Man U, Chelsea, and Arsenal) make up the top four teams all three years. With the same teams always at the top, the league seems to be very unbalanced. Considering that in 12 years of the EPL only two teams won 11 of the championships, the balance in the EPL seems to be nonexistent.\\n\\nAltering Competitive Balance:\\n\\nThere are many actions leagues can take to preserve competitive balance, including revenue sharing, salary caps or luxury taxes, and a draft system. The EPL has a revenue sharing plan in place where each club gets $44.4 million from the TV broadcasting deal each year. While the exact impact the revenue sharing deal has on the competitive balance in the league is difficult to determine, it is almost certain that the league is more balanced than without it. With revenue sharing, less wealthy teams are provided a better chance at higher-priced, better quality players, in turn promoting the competitive balance within the league.\\n\\nSalary caps work almost in reverse order as revenue sharing does, in that they restricts the wealthier teams’ ability to buy all of the top talent. Without a salary cap, teams in the league can spend as much money on players as they would like, and those more well-off teams will have better opportunity for the better players. This decreases competitive balance as it increases the chances of the better, more expensive players being on the same team. Currently, the EPL does not have a salary cap in place and teams can offer any amount of money to entice a player to sign with their team. For example, Manchester City purchased Carlos Tevez for €35 million from Manchester United, while James Collins went to Aston Villa for only €6.7 million.\\n\\nFinally, a draft, especially a reverse-order entry draft, can help promote competitive balance. A reverse-order entry draft allows teams to choose incoming players in the reverse order from their finish in the previous season. By allowing the worst teams the first choice in the draft, more wealthy teams’ have restricted access to these players which helps balance the league. Rather than a draft, the EPL uses a transfer window, where there are certain times during the season in which teams may pursue players and purchase or loan players across teams. Because this does not hinder the more wealthy teams from buying all the talent, it does not do well at promoting competitive balance.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nCompetitive balance is crucial in the success of any league. It allows a maximum number of fans, ultimately maximizing revenues for the league. While there are many measures of competitive balance, no one is better than another. Rather, depending on the scenario or league in question, one measure may be more useful than another. Based on the within-season variation calculations and analysis of the factors of competitive balance, the EPL does not seem to be competitively balanced. With the same four teams in the top four positions over the three seasons considered, no salary cap in place, and no useful draft system, the competitive balance is likely far from what it could be.\\n\\nAppendix\\n\\n2006/07 Standard Deviation:\\n\\n2007/08 Standard Deviation:\\n\\n2008/09 Standard Deviation:\\n\\nSources\\n\\n\\\"EPL Teams Earn Almost $1.59B As Part Of Payout From TV Deal.\\\" Sports Business Daily 16 May 2008: n. pag.
